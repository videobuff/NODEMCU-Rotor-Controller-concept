## NodeMCU Rotor Controller

This project makes it possible to control an analogue rotor by means of a web interface.
In my case it is an old Kenpro KR400RC
Hardware required is a ESP8266 NodeMCU as well as some kind of relay board.
I use the HL-52S for CW and CCW operatuon
If you have a brake to operate, look for a three relay borad or more.
